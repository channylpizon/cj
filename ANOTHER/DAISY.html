        Daisies are a very popular flower that can be found on every continent other than Antarctica. They belong to one of the largest known plant families and symbolized innocence, a connotation that comes from the Victorian era. Based on what color the daisy is, the flower can take on a different meaning. Daisy flowers prefer full sun and average soil conditions. Depending on the variety, they can grow anywhere from 8 inches to 4 feet. Care tip: Only water during the summer if rainfall is less than 1 inch per week.</p>
