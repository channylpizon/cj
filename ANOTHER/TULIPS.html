<h1>TULIPS</h1>
    <p><img src="https://gifdb.com/images/high/spring-tulip-flowers-esg9s9jrn0vchq18.gif" width="400" height="475">
        Tulips are the most colorful of all spring flowers. They are also one of the easiest flowers you'll ever grow. Just plant the bulbs in fall for blossoms the following spring.

        There are hundreds of beautiful tulips to choose from, in enough colors, shapes, sizes and bloom times to inspire every gardenerâ€™s creativity. Whether you plant them in groups of 10 or 1000, tulips always put on an impressive show.
        
        When you compare two tulip bulbs side by side, it's easy to see differences in quality. Larger bulbs (as shown at far left) contain more stored food energy and will produce stronger stems and bigger blooms. A healthy tulip bulb should feel firm (not dry or mushy). A small amount of surface mold is normal.
        
        Tulip bulbs are measured in centimeters around the "waist" of the bulb. Longfield Gardens supplies tulip bulbs that are at least 12cm in circumference. This ensures you will always get the biggest, brightest blooms.
        
        Each year's crop of tulip bulbs is a little different, due to weather conditions during the growing season and the late summer harvest. Bulb size also varies by cultivar, with some varieties of tulips naturally producing larger bulbs than others. We purchase the largest, highest quality bulbs possible so you can enjoy a beautiful display of spring flowers.
