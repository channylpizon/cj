<p>Cultivated mums originated in China more than 3,000 years ago, and have become familiar and well-loved fall flowers the world over. Thousands of varieties with unique flower shapes brighten home gardens, containers, median strips, and parking lots from late summer through frost with their delightful orange, red, yellow, purple, or white blooms. Chrysanthemums are easy to grow perennials and will come back year after year if planted early in the season, so that they become established before winter. In addition to their beauty, chrysanthemum flowers can be made into a tea, and the leaves can be eaten as salad greens. </p>
